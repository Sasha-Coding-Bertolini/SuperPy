# Report

Three technical elements of my program that are notable.

# 1. Data Manipulation and Analysis with pandas:

The code effectively utilizes the pandas library to handle data manipulation and analysis tasks. It reads CSV files using the `pd.read_csv()` function and converts date columns to the datetime format using `pd.to_datetime()`. This enables convenient filtering and manipulation of dates in subsequent operations. The code demonstrates the use of pandas DataFrame operations such as selecting rows based on conditions `(df[df["buy_date"] <= manipulate_date(num_days_inventory)])` and calculating the sum of values in a specific column `(selected_rows["buy_price"].sum())`. These operations allow for flexible data processing and extraction of relevant information.

# 2. Styling and Displaying Tabular Data with Rich:

The code employs the Rich library to enhance the visual presentation of tabular data. The `print_table()` function utilizes the Rich module's Table class to create a visually appealing table. It dynamically adds columns based on the DataFrame's header and iterates over the rows to populate the table. The Rich library provides flexible customization options, allowing the code to specify table headers, column styles, and even console-based formatting. The resulting table is then printed using the `console.print()` function, providing a neat and well-organized representation of the data.

# 3. Modular and Reusable Design:

The program demonstrates a modular and reusable design by organizing the functionality into separate functions. Each function focuses on a specific task, such as reporting inventory, revenue, or profit, and follows the principle of separation of concerns. This modular structure improves code readability, maintainability, and testability. It allows for easy extension or modification of individual components without impacting the overall functionality. Furthermore, the code embraces parameterization, accepting various input parameters to customize the reports generated. This flexibility enables users to obtain inventory reports based on specific dates, time periods, or other filtering criteria, enhancing the usefulness and adaptability of the codebase.
